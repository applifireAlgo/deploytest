Log Events goes to the Queue first and connectors takes the event from the queue for processing. Event Queue Type 0 - Circular Queue (RECOMMENDED) 1 - Infinite Queue with Initial Capacity and events will be wrapped in Soft References (JVM will garbage collect these soft references when it runs out of memory). 2 - Infinite Queue (NOT RECOMMENDED)#appfire#Alarm Queue Type#appfire#1#appfire#\N#appfire#2015-12-21 11:48:16#appfire#\N#appfire#2015-12-21 11:48:16#appfire#1

Once the configuration is refreshed new Log Events will be written to the configured Target (File, DB etc). This will help to isolate and troubleshoot a production environment without shutting down the application. #appfire#Refresh Frequency#appfire#1#appfire#\N#appfire#2015-12-21 11:48:16#appfire#\N#appfire#2015-12-21 11:48:16#appfire#1
